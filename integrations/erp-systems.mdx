From day one, our goal has been to make the developer experience seamless. We wanted Mage to be present wherever agents are being built.
With our MCP integration, you’ve already seen how effortlessly Mage can connect with agent frameworks like OpenAI Assistants, A2A, CrewAI, and others — enabling developers to plug payments, spend controls, and transaction capabilities directly into their agents with minimal setup.

>### Next: Native ERP Plugins
>
>Our next big step is native plugins for ERP systems — the primary engines driving agent adoption in enterprises. ERP platforms manage critical business processes, and they hold the data agents need to act intelligently.
With our ERP plugins, you’ll be able to connect accounts payable, procurement, accounts receivable, spend management, and treasury management agents directly to Mage for instant, compliant transactions.

### How It Will Work

**Currently, most ERP workflows look like this:**

- ERP generates sheets of invoices ready for payment.
- This data is sent to the bank for manual transaction processing.
- The result? Delays, late payment penalties, and a lower cash conversion cycle.

**With Mage ERP plugins:**

- As soon as the agent gets payment-ready invoice data and post it to ERP. It can initiate and settle the payment in milliseconds, securely and with full compliance.
- Businesses reduce delays, avoid penalties, and optimize cash flow instantly.
