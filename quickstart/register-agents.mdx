Once your Mage account is funded (with test funds in sandbox or real funds in production), you can start registering AI agents so they can perform transactions on your behalf.

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Go to the Agent Registry">

- From the left-hand sidebar in the Mage dashboard, click **Agent Registry**.

</Step>

<Step title="Step 2: Create a New Agent">

- Click **+ Add New Agent** in the top-right corner of the Agent Registry page.

</Step>

<Step title="Step 3: Complete KYA (Know Your Agent)">

Every new agent must go through the KYA process.

Here’s what you’ll fill in:

### **A. Fill Basic Information**

1. **Name** — Give your agent a clear, descriptive name (e.g., “Procurement Agent”).
2. **Description** — Describe what this agent does (e.g., “Handles supplier payments for procurement workflows”).
3. **Tags** (Max 5) — Add keywords to help you organize and filter agents later.

Click **Next** to proceed.

### **B. Set Spend Rules**

Here you define how much your agent can spend and under what conditions.

1. **Add Fund Allowance Limit** — The total amount of funds that can be added to the agent.
2. **Transaction Limit** — The maximum amount per transaction.
3. **Require Approval for All Transactions** — Choose “Yes” if every transaction needs human approval.
4. **Only Trusted Payees Allowed** — Choose “Yes” if payments can only go to pre-approved recipients. You can register them [here](https://www.notion.so/Trusted-Entities-24d3855747df805485abc459ea3640c9?pvs=21).
5. **Per Transaction Limit** — Set an additional cap for each transaction (can be the same or lower than Transaction Limit).
6. **Max Allowance** — The absolute maximum amount this agent can control.
7. **Session Time** — The duration (in minutes) an active session is valid for transactions.
8. **Auto Approve Threshold** — Any transaction below this amount will be automatically approved.
9. **Allowed Payment Methods** — Select the payment rails your agent can use (e.g., ACH Bank Transfer, Mage IDs, Checkout, etc.).

Click **Next** when done.

### **C. Select Prompt Screening Policy**

You’ll now define the agent’s security and prompt handling rules. You can:

- Choose a **Predefined Policy**:
    - **Mage Default Policy** — Maximum security, strictest controls.
    - **Enterprise Policy** — Balanced security and operational flow.
    - **Developer Policy** — Minimal friction, basic safety (best for testing).
- **Or create a Custom Policy**:
    - Name your policy.
    - Describe it.
    - Adjust security sliders for **Intent Validation**, **Language Processing**, and **Transaction Monitoring**.
    - Add **Custom Categories** with expressions to block specific types of prompts.

Once selected or created, click **Submit & Finish**.

</Step>

<Step title="Step 4: Agent Registration Complete">

Your agent will now appear in the **Agent Registry** with:

- Assigned **Agent ID**
- Spend rules applied
- Tags
- Approval rules
- Session duration

</Step>

<Step title="Step 5: Monitor Child Agents">

When the parent agent performs transactions, Mage automatically creates **Child Agents** for each transaction session.

You can view:

- Session IDs
- Child Agent IDs
- User on whose behalf the transaction was made
- Status (e.g., CLOSED)
- Scoped balance (funds allocated for that session)
- Payment rails used
- Transaction hash for record tracking

This workflow ensures your agents are registered with clear permissions, strict guardrails, and proper security before they can access your funds.
