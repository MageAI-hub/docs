For developers building **consumer-facing products**, there’s often a need to:

- **Collect payments** from users.
- **Credit their accounts** so their agents can make purchases on their behalf.

For example, if you’re building a personal shopping assistant, your user might top up credits, and the agent will use those credits to complete purchases.

Mage makes this process simple. You can:

1. **Integrate a Stripe webhook** to handle payments externally.
2. **Collect money directly** via Mage’s built-in checkout module.

## **Monetization Modes**

Mage supports three ways to monetize your agents and services:

1. **Credit-based**
    - Users purchase credits, which can be spent by agents for transactions.
    - Ideal for usage-based services.
2. **Time-based (Subscription)**
    - Users pay for a set duration of access (e.g., monthly, yearly).
    - Perfect for recurring service models.
3. **One-time Payment**
    - Single payment for a specific service or product.
    - Best for one-off transactions.

## **Creating a Payment Link**

1. Go to **Checkout Module** in your Mage dashboard.
2. Click **Create Product**.
3. Fill in:
    - **Product Logo** (optional)
    - **Product Name** and **Description**
    - **Payment Type** (Credit-based, Time-based, or One-time)
4. Once created, a **Payment Link** will be generated.
5. Add this payment link directly to your app or checkout page — users can pay instantly, and credits or access time will be applied to their account.

## **Example Flow**

1. User visits your checkout page.
2. User clicks the Mage payment link.
3. Mage processes the payment and updates the user’s credit balance or subscription status instantly.
4. The agent can now use those credits to make purchases.


<Note>
This feature will be available in the production environment. In sandbox mode, you can test the flow without processing real payments.
