**When we started building Mage, we could have just focused on making payments work for AI agents.**

But here's the thing: Your CFO doesn't just want payments that work, they want payments they can trust. Your compliance team doesn't just want fast transactions they want auditable ones. And you don't just want an API, you want peace of mind.

Thatâ€™s why Mage is built on four foundational layers of HEART. Each layer is designed to deliver not just functionality, but confidence.

From how agents are identified and authorized to how every transaction is logged, verified, and enforced, these layers ensure payments are secure, compliant, and trustworthy by design.
