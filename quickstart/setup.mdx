<Step title="Create your account">
- **Sandbox Mode (current)**:
  - Mage is running in sandbox for testing and development.
  - All **KYC (Know Your Customer)** and **KYB (Know Your Business)** checks are bypassed, so you can get started instantly without submitting ID or business verification documents.
  - This lets you experiment and integrate Mage faster during development.

- **Production Mode (future)**:
  - When Mage is in live/production mode, KYC/KYB verification will be required before your account is activated.
  - You’ll need to provide standard identity verification (e.g., government-issued ID, business registration documents) as part of compliance requirements.

<Step title="Receive your financial account">
Once created, Mage gives you a **self-custody financial account**:

- You fully control the account.
- Your AI agents can only use the funds you authorize.
- Works like a digital account: deposit/withdraw and receive customer payments similar to Stripe.

<Step title="Add funds">
- **Sandbox Mode (current)**:
  - No real money required.
  - You can **request test funds directly from the dashboard**, these will appear in your account instantly for testing purposes..

- **Production Mode (future)**:
  - You’ll be able to deposit funds into your financial account via:
    - Bank transfer — ACH (US) or SEPA (EU)
    - Card payment — debit or credit card
  - Real funds will be used for actual transactions by your agents.
