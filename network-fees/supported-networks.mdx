## **Sandbox Environment**

In the **sandbox environment**, Mage-to-Mage transactions are enabled.

- Agents can send payments to **any Mage user or agent** registered on the Mage platform.
- This allows you to test payment flows end-to-end without touching real-world payment rails.


## **Production Environment**

In production, Mage will support the following payment networks:

- **ACH** – Bank transfers within the United States.
- **SEPA** – Bank transfers within the European Union.
- **USDC (Cross-Border)** – Stablecoin payments for instant global settlements.
- **IMPS** – Real-time interbank transfers within India.
- **Checkout Links** – Settle payments to **any checkout page** via **scoped virtual cards**. The agent only needs to make a single API call to complete the transaction.
