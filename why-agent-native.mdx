### **What's Already Working**

AI agents today can:

- Research markets and negotiate contracts
- Analyze data and make complex decisions
- Automate entire business workflows
- Handle customer service and operations
- Process documents and manage inventory

**There’s an MCP server or API tool for nearly every use case out there except for enabling AI agents to move money.**

### **Why is that?**

**Current fintech is built for humans and is UI driven.**

Want to transfer money to someone? You need to:

- Open a bank account
- Navigate through multiple UI screens
- Fill out forms manually
- Wait for human verification
- Click "Send" on a web interface

Want to buy something online?

- Navigate checkout pages
- Fill credit card forms
- Handle 2FA pop-ups
- Deal with CAPTCHA challenges
- Click through multiple confirmation screens

Current financial systems are manual and UI-based, making them human-centric and incompatible with AI agents that rely purely on API calls.

### **Mage, Our AI Native Infrastructure fixes that.**

We've built a headless, API-first payments infrastructure purpose-built for AI agents.

This allows agents to move money across banks, checkouts, and other agents with a single API call at scale – handling amounts ranging from as little as 0.0001 to over 100 million.

**One API call**

**Any amount**

**Anywhere**

**24/7/365 availability**

### **But There’s a Deeper Problem**

Technology alone doesn’t solve this.

We humans don’t fully trust AI to handle our money yet.

Money is sensitive and personal. Mission-critical. Mistakes are costly.

And current fintech systems weren’t built to support agent-driven payments. They lack the foundational infrastructure and guardrails to handle such transactions securely  with precision and trust.

That’s why we didn’t just build Mage to be fast and functional, We built it with something deeper in mind.

**We built it with “HEART”.**
