The **Trusted Entities** section in Mage allows you to define and manage all the **pre-approved recipients** your agents are allowed to interact with. This acts as a whitelist, ensuring that your agents can only send payments, share data, or perform actions with known and authorized parties.

Trusted entities can be:

1. **E-commerce Domains** – Approved websites or platforms where agents are allowed to complete transactions.
2. **Bank Accounts** – Pre-approved recipient accounts for secure fund transfers.
3. **Mage IDs** – Verified Mage user or agent IDs for internal transfers or agent-to-agent transactions.

### Where Trusted Entities Are Used

Trusted Entities are a **key part of your Spend Rules** when registering agents:

- If **“Only Trusted Payees Allowed”** is enabled in an agent’s spend rules, the agent can only send money or perform actions involving entities on this list.
- This provides strong fraud prevention and operational control.
- It’s especially important in production mode, where real funds are being moved.
