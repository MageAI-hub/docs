Mage is built for developers and organizations shaping the future of agentic workflows. Whether you're building autonomous agents, deploying them in production, or creating tools for others to do so, Mage provides the financial, compliance, and execution infrastructure needed to operate safely and at scale.

### **Agent Developers**

If you are building AI agents that take real-world actions like making payments or initiating purchases, Mage gives you tools to enforce guardrails, trigger payments, and monitor agent behavior via a single API.

Example: An AI agent that autonomously books flights, hotels, and more for your customers. You can use Mage to complete checkout pages and make purchases on their behalf.

### **Enterprises Building Agentic Workflows**

For companies building internal agents for operations, finance, or procurement, Mage enables controlled execution without compromising compliance or oversight.

Example: An internal enterprise agent that processes invoices can use Mage to route them for approval and trigger cross-border payments.

### **Agent Platforms and Tooling Startups**

Mage is well-suited for platforms that help others create and deploy agents. You can embed Mageâ€™s infrastructure to provide your users with secure payments, compliance, and audit capabilities out of the box.

Example: A developer platform that lets users build agents to act on their behalf, with Mage enforcing spending controls and approvals behind the scenes.
