Low-code and no-code agent builders are becoming the go-to for teams that want to rapidly prototype and deploy AI agents without deep coding expertise. These platforms use canvas-based, drag-and-drop interfaces to let users visually design agent workflows.

With the Mage native plugin, integrating payments, spend rules, and transaction capabilities into these workflows becomes as easy as dragging and dropping Mage into the flow. Developers and non-technical teams alike can instantly give their agents the power to initiate secure, rule-bound transactions â€” without writing custom payment integration code.

### Native integrations are on the way for these platforms:
